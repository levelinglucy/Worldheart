# Worldheart — developer notes

## Development summary

**Candidate:** `v0.2.1-rc1` (not yet designated stable). **Goal:** counterfactual probes cannot modify the live simulation's disk artifacts.  
**Historical baseline:** `Worldheart simulator` (`v0.2-primordial`), preserved byte-for-byte in the same repository.  
**Latest changes:** new candidate script with per-fork disk isolation, regression tests and GitHub Actions.  
**Next priorities:** verify CI on the final candidate revision, check a longer-horizon replay, then promote only after candidate criteria are met.  
**Links:** [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) · [README](./README.md) · [Tests](./tests/test_probe_isolation.py).

## How the original code works

Worldheart starts from a seeded random graph and population of byte-string structures. Each transition processes VM instructions and environmental changes. An external observer keeps metrics, events, anomaly fossils and persistence snapshots. The `counterfactual_probe` function clones the world twice, removes one structure from the altered copy, advances both and compares metrics. The original probe used `World.fork()`, which clones *state* but does not automatically isolate external effects. This note describes verified source structure, not the original author's motivation.

### Why the change is needed

In `v0.2-primordial`, both forks share module-level `SAVE_DIR` and `SAVE_FILE`. At `CHECKPOINT_EVERY`, `transition()` calls `save()`, replacing the latest checkpoint with a fork; `event()` writes to the shared event journal and `preserve_fossil()` writes to the shared fossil directory. Thus a seemingly private experiment can contaminate the world that users expect to resume. This candidate's regression suite demonstrates the baseline checkpoint write in a temporary directory.

### Candidate design

`World._disk_writes_enabled` is a per-instance persistence permission, defaulting to `True`; `_can_write_disk()` treats old pickled instances without the new field as `True`, for backward compatibility. `World.fork(disk_writes_enabled=None)` preserves the source world's current permission unless explicitly overridden.

The counterfactual probe uses `world.fork(disk_writes_enabled=False)` for both experimental branches. In those branches, `event()` and `preserve_fossil()` still add to **in-memory** observer data, but do not write files; `transition()` skips automatic disk checkpoints; `save()` and `save_named()` fail explicitly rather than silently persisting an experimental universe. Ordinary worlds and ordinary forks retain previous save behaviour. No new dependencies or global monkeypatches are introduced.

**Security boundary:** Loading an untrusted checkpoint can execute code because checkpoints use `pickle`. The per-fork disk flag is not a sandbox or defence against untrusted pickle; do not use this candidate with untrusted checkpoint files.

## Engineering decision 001 — per-instance disk isolation

**Alternatives considered:** (A) change the module-level save directory temporarily; (B) run probes in a disposable directory; (C) keep a persistence guard per cloned world; (D) disable all persistence for all worlds.

**Chosen:** C. It remains local to each simulation, does not depend on changing process working directories, preserves normal save semantics, and explicitly rejects disk saves from private forks. A would risk global side effects if exceptions or concurrency intervene; B requires extra filesystem work and can still leak external writes; D removes expected checkpoint functionality.

**Trade-offs:** Adds a small state field and guards several I/O paths; any future disk output needs to respect the guard. Explicit `fork()` without an argument is still allowed to persist, maintaining compatibility but requiring future experimental callers to opt out. Reconsider a dedicated observer/storage abstraction if new disk effects proliferate, or a safer portable data format if untrusted-source interoperability becomes a product requirement.

**Evidence:** The candidate tests include legacy reproduction, checkpoint-and-journal byte comparisons, in-memory state equality, no fossil artifacts, and ordinary-save compatibility. Only mark CI as confirmed when the exact relevant GitHub Actions job has passed.

## Roadmap and release gates

| Stage | Intended result | Acceptance | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v0.2 historical baseline | Preserve existing deterministic simulator | Original source remains unchanged | Preserved |
| v0.2.1-rc1 candidate | Disk-isolated counterfactual probe | Regression demonstrates baseline issue; fork leaves checkpoint, log, fossil files and live state unchanged; normal saves work | Candidate, validation under way |
| v0.2.1 stable (proposed) | Safe recommended entry point | Exact candidate tests pass, inspect diff and compatibility, document limitations and recovery | Planned, not released |
| Future (optional) | Better portable checkpoints | Threat model, migration and replay equivalence tests | Idea only |

## Continuation checklist

1. Verify GitHub Actions on the final candidate commit and inspect failures or warnings.
2. Independently exercise a probe that crosses multiple automatic checkpoint boundaries and observe all filesystem artifacts; validate replay consistency and metrics.
3. If checks pass, review a promotion path for the candidate without deleting or overwriting `Worldheart simulator`. Label stable only after the actual promotion is performed.

**Design questions:** Should a dedicated persistence backend replace scattered file calls in a later feature version? Should saved games move from pickle to a versioned, validated structured format? Neither is required to make this specific probe fix.

**How to resume:** Start from the latest Worldheart branch/PR and check its exact head. Compare the candidate script with historical source, read the regression workflow, then update the roadmap and changelog only with verified outcomes.
